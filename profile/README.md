# Hey, this is CNAP üëã

![landing page screenshot](./landing.png)

We're building the future of cloud-native application platforms. Since our inception, we've been working tirelessly to create a unified ecosystem for developers, providers, and users of cloud-native apps. Our mission? To simplify the installation, management, and monetization of cloud-native applications while providing a secure and user-friendly environment for all stakeholders.

### üöÄ An interconnected cloud-native community

The cloud-native community is the üíó heart of CNAP and fundamental to how we build and deploy software today. We're addressing the key challenges in the cloud-native space:

- **72% of companies use multiple cloud-native application platforms**, highlighting the need for flexibility but also creating management and consistency challenges.
- **65% of stakeholders report at least one direct financial benefit from cloud-native approaches**, including new revenue-generating customer experiences (26%) and improved IT staff efficiency (70%).
- However, **55% cite compliance with security and governance requirements as the biggest challenge** in creating or adopting a cloud-native application platform.
